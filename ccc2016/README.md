# CCC Info

This was the 2016 competition. I wrote the junior portion, but since I finished early I tried to tackle problem 5 of the senior (which I think I did successfully.)

I'll update y'all on the score I got soon.

## Thoughts and Tips
* Junior was actually pretty easy, just got to study.
* I'm pretty happy that I downloaded the Python Docs, pdf style. I suggest you do as well.
* Things that stopped me from finishing in lightspeed were mainly typecasting, syntax (it had been a long time since I'd coded in python), typecasting, string/array methods, and typecasting.
* Notice I said typecasting a lot; since I was used to PHP, I normally didn't really care about declaring types/typecasting, but the difference between String numbers and int numbers screwed me several times (most notably on J5 and S5)
* The method that gave me the most trouble was sorted(), since it sorted int's "alphabetically", so 100 would come before 78. Big whoop.

# 99problems

Hey there! **99problems** probably isn't going to have 99 actual problems, but it's a group of problems, paradoxes, and other interesting situations that I've solved (mostly for bragging rights and DMCS club). It's a fun time!

*Disclaimer: this code is far from perfect (it's often super inefficient). If you see a problem, make an issue or a fork: any help is welcomed!*

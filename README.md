# dmcs
This repo acts as an "other" bin of my computer science/digital media workings: random prototypes, teaching examples, and me messing around with a few frameworks. You can take a peek around, but it ain't going to be pretty here. You can preview most of my code at [my website](http://matthewwang.me).

Heads up! If you want to clone this repo, you don't really need the revision history. It's super big. Use `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/malsf21/dmcs.git` instead.
